# Getting Started with Noderr: A Complete Guide

**Welcome to Noderr!**

Noderr is a systematic development methodology that transforms your AI assistant from a chaotic coder into a disciplined, professional software engineer. It uses a structured loop and a library of prompts to build software that is well-documented, properly tested, and robust enough for long-term maintenance.

**Why Noderr?**
Without structure, every AI-driven project risks the same fate: initial rapid progress followed by unmanageable complexity, outdated documentation, and eventual abandonment. Noderr prevents this by instilling professional software engineering practices into the AI's workflow from day one.

## Quick Start: Your First Project with Noderr

### Overview of the Process

Unlike traditional setups, Noderr has a unique workflow:

1. **Prepare** your project vision (3 key files)
2. **Build** an initial prototype with AI
3. **Install** Noderr to manage the project going forward
4. **Develop** systematically using the Noderr loop

This approach ensures Noderr documents what you ACTUALLY built, not just what you planned.

## Initial Setup Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Vision (Before Any Coding)

You need to create three foundational documents. There are many ways to approach this - through conversation with your AI, using specific prompts, or a combination. Here's one structured approach:

#### Option A: Structured Design Strategy Approach

1. **Blueprint/Design Document** (using a Design Strategy prompt)
   - One effective method is using a UI/UX Design Strategy System prompt
   - This generates Design Pillars → Implementation Tasks → Visual Blueprint
   - Provides comprehensive strategic foundation for your project

2. **Project Overview** (`noderr_project.md`)
   - Can use `ND__Project_Generator.md` prompt (if available)
   - Or create through conversation based on your blueprint
   - Defines technology stack, standards, and scope

3. **Architecture Diagram** (`noderr_architecture.md`)
   - Can use `ND__Architecture_Generator.md` prompt (if available)
   - Or design through discussion using your blueprint as reference
   - Creates the technical system design

#### Option B: Conversational Approach

Simply have an extended conversation with your AI about:
- What you want to build
- Who will use it
- Core features and functionality
- Technical preferences
- System design

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach

Mix prompts and conversation:
- Start with a structured prompt for initial ideas
- Refine through conversation
- Use specific prompts for technical details

**Pro tip:** Create all three documents in the same chat session, allowing each to inform and refine the others. The key is having clear, comprehensive plans before any code is written.

### Step 2: Build Your Initial Prototype

1. **Give all three documents to your AI**
   ```
   "Here are my project plans: [paste the 3 documents]
   Please build the initial version of this application."
   ```

2. **Let the AI build the first version**
   - It will create the basic structure
   - Implement core features
   - Set up the project

3. **Test and verify** the initial build works

### Step 3: Install Noderr (After Initial Build)

NOW extract the Noderr ZIP into your project root:

```bash
# Extract the ZIP
unzip noderr-starter.zip -d your-project/

# You should see:
your-project/
├── your-code-files...        (already built)
└── noderr/                   (just extracted)
    ├── environment_context.md
    ├── noderr_project.md
    └── ... other Noderr files
```

### Step 4: Run Install and Reconcile

Give your AI this command:
> **`ND__Install_And_Reconcile.md`**

This critical step will:
1. **Analyze** what was actually built vs. planned
2. **Update** the project and architecture files to match reality
3. **PAUSE** for your review and approval
4. **Create** detailed specs for every component
5. **Configure** your development environment
6. **Set up** the tracking system

**Important:** The AI will pause after updating the project files. Review them carefully before approving continuation.

### Step 5: Begin Systematic Development

Once installation is complete:
> **`ND__Start_Work_Session.md`**

You're now ready to use the Noderr loop for all future development!

## The Heart of Noderr: The Four-Step Loop

Every feature you build follows this robust, structured loop:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    THE NODERR LOOP                     │
│                                                        │
│  You Provide a `PrimaryGoal` (e.g., "Add user login")  │
│                      ↓                                 │
│  [LOOP 1A] Propose Change Set                          │
│       ↓ (Agent analyzes impact, you approve)           │
│  [LOOP 1B] Draft Specs                                 │
│       ↓ (Agent writes specs, you approve)              │
│  [LOOP 2] Implement Change Set                         │
│       ↓ (Agent builds & tests the entire set)          │
│  [LOOP 3] Finalize & Commit                            │
│       ↓ (Agent updates docs, logs, and commits)        │
│                                                        │
│  ← Return to Start Work Session for the next Goal      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What Each Step Does:

**`ND__[LOOP_1A]__Propose_Change_Set.md`**
*   **Agent's Job:** Analyzes the `PrimaryGoal` and identifies every single new or existing node that will be affected.
*   **Your Job:** Review and approve the proposed Change Set.

**`ND__[LOOP_1B]__Draft_Specs.md`**
*   **Agent's Job:** Marks all nodes as `[WIP]` and writes detailed specifications.
*   **Your Job:** Review the specs in the `specs/` directory.

**`ND__[LOOP_2]__Implement_Change_Set.md`**
*   **Agent's Job:** Writes all code, runs tests, and verifies against specs.
*   **Your Job:** Monitor progress, available for any blockers.

**`ND__[LOOP_3]__Finalize_And_Commit.md`**
*   **Agent's Job:** Updates specs to "as-built" state, logs work, commits.
*   **Your Job:** Nothing - this step is fully automated.

## Your Daily Workflow

### Starting Every Work Session

Always begin with:
> **`ND__Start_Work_Session.md`**

The agent will:
- Sync with your project state
- Review recent changes
- Suggest the next logical task

### Building a New Feature (Example)

```
You: ND__Start_Work_Session.md
Agent: "Ready for the next PrimaryGoal."

You: "Primary Goal: Add password reset functionality"
Agent: [Starts LOOP 1A]
      "To add password reset, I need to:
      - NEW: UI_PasswordResetForm, API_ResetPassword, EMAIL_ResetTemplate
      - MODIFY: UI_LoginPage (add 'forgot password' link)
      - MODIFY: DB_Users (add reset_token field)
      
      Approve this Change Set?"

You: "I approve"
Agent: [Continues through the loop...]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Command not found" or environment errors
**Symptoms:** AI tries to run commands that don't work

**Solutions:**
- Check `environment_context.md` was filled out during installation
- Verify commands work in your terminal
- Common fixes:
  - Use `python3` instead of `python`
  - Add `npx` before commands
  - Include virtual environment activation

#### AI seems confused about project state
**Symptoms:** AI suggests already-completed tasks or misunderstands architecture

**Solutions:**
- Run `ND__Start_Work_Session.md` to resync
- Check all NodeIDs in tracker have spec files
- Verify architecture diagram matches implementation
- Ensure recent changes were committed

#### Initial build doesn't match plans
**Symptoms:** What was built differs significantly from blueprints

**Solutions:**
- This is normal! Plans evolve during implementation
- The Install_And_Reconcile process handles this
- Review the reconciled files carefully before approving
- The system documents reality, not ideals

#### Changes aren't being tracked
**Symptoms:** Progress percentage wrong, work not showing as verified

**Solutions:**
- Follow the complete 4-step Loop
- Check `noderr_tracker.md` shows correct statuses
- Verify git commits are happening
- Don't skip steps - each updates different files

### Getting Help

When stuck, check these in order:
1. **Review `noderr_log.md`** - Recent entries often reveal issues
2. **Check `noderr_tracker.md`** - Ensure dependencies are correct
3. **Verify architecture** - Missing connections cause confusion
4. **Test environment commands** - Manual testing reveals broken commands
5. **Review recent git commits** - See what actually changed
