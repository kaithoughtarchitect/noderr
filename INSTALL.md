# Installing Noderr

## Prerequisites

Before installing Noderr:
- You should have prepared your project vision (blueprint, project overview, architecture)
- You should have built an initial prototype based on those plans
- You should have Git initialized in your project

## Installation

### 1. Download Noderr

Download the latest release: [noderr-starter.zip](https://github.com/kaithoughtarchitect/noderr/releases/latest/download/noderr-starter.zip)

### 2. Add to Your Project

Extract the ZIP and add the `noderr` folder to your project:
- Drag and drop the folder into your project
- Upload the folder to your codebase (for cloud IDEs)
- Or extract directly in your project directory

That's it! You now have the Noderr framework in your project.

### 3. Run Install and Reconcile
Give your AI assistant this prompt:
```
ND__Install_And_Reconcile.md
```

### 4. Run System Audit
Verify everything is ready:
```
ND__Post_Installation_Audit.md
```
This ensures 100% architectural completeness and system readiness.

### 5. Review and Approve
When the AI pauses:
- Review audit report for any issues
- Address any critical gaps identified
- Confirm development readiness percentage

## Post-Installation
Once audit shows 100% readiness:
```
ND__Start_Work_Session.md
```
