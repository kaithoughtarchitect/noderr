## What is Noderr?

Noderr gives AI what every senior developer has: **permanent memory** and **system understanding**.

### Quick Start

1. **Prepare Your Vision** - Create blueprint, project overview, and architecture documents
2. **Build Initial Prototype** - AI creates your first version based on the plans
3. **Install Noderr** - Extract framework and reconcile with what was built
4. **Develop Systematically** - Use the Noderr loop for all future development

*Noderr documents what you ACTUALLY built, not just what you planned.*

### Prerequisites
- Any AI assistant that can read/write files (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- Basic familiarity with AI-assisted coding
- A project idea (new or existing)

## The Noderr Difference

### 1. Building Blocks with Identity (NodeIDs)

Every piece of your system gets a unique, permanent name:
- `UI_LoginForm` - That specific login form
- `API_AuthCheck` - That specific authentication endpoint  
- `SVC_TokenValidator` - That specific validation service

Unlike traditional AI coding where the AI forgets what it built between conversations, NodeIDs give each building block a permanent identity that persists forever.

**The Impact:** Instead of "update the login", you can say "update `API_AuthCheck`" and the AI knows EXACTLY what you mean, even months later.

### 2. Visual Architecture That Remembers

These NodeIDs aren't just labels - they live in a visual map (Mermaid diagram) that shows:
- **WHERE** each piece fits in your system
- **HOW** it connects to other pieces
- **WHAT** depends on it

```

The AI uses this visual memory to understand that changing `API_AuthCheck` will affect both the login form above it and the validator below it.

### 3. Blueprints for Every Building Block (Specifications)

Each NodeID has its own detailed blueprint in the `specs/` folder. These contain:
- Purpose and responsibilities
- Dependencies and interfaces
- Core logic and behavior
- Verification criteria
- Technical debt notes

### 4. Lightning-Fast Context Assembly

When you say "Fix the login timeout issue", here's what happens:

1. AI looks at the visual architecture
2. Finds `API_AuthCheck` and sees all connections
3. Reads only the relevant specs
4. Has perfect understanding in seconds

No more loading entire codebases or missing critical connections.

### 5. Mission Control Dashboard (Tracker)

See everything at a glance:

| Status | WorkGroupID | NodeID | Dependencies | Progress |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| üü¢ | - | UI_LoginForm | - | VERIFIED |
| üü° | feat-20250107-143022 | API_AuthCheck | UI_LoginForm | WIP |
| ‚ö™Ô∏è | - | API_PasswordReset | API_AuthCheck | TODO |

Track what's done, what's in progress, what's blocked, and what's next.

### 6. Perfect Historical Memory (Log)

Every significant action is permanently recorded:
- What was built and when
- Why decisions were made
- What problems were discovered
- What technical debt was created

The AI can answer "Why does this code look weird?" with "According to the log, we had to work around a third-party API limitation on Jan 15."

## Core Concepts in 30 Seconds

### üè∑Ô∏è **NodeIDs - Permanent Identity**
Every building block gets a unique name (like `API_AuthCheck` or `UI_LoginForm`) that persists across all AI sessions forever. No more "what login are you talking about?"

### üì¶ **Change Sets - Complete Updates**
AI identifies ALL NodeIDs affected by a feature and updates them together. No more partial implementations that break other features.

### üó∫Ô∏è **Visual Architecture - Spatial Memory**  
NodeIDs live in a Mermaid diagram showing how everything connects. AI sees your system as an architect would - not as random files.

### üìã **Living Specifications**
Each NodeID has a detailed blueprint (spec) that evolves from plan ‚Üí built ‚Üí verified. AI always knows what each NodeID should do.

### üìä **Real-Time Mission Control**
The tracker dashboard shows exactly what's done, what's in progress, and what's blocked - with WorkGroupIDs that track related changes together.

## How is Noderr Different?

| Traditional AI Coding | Noderr |
|----------------------|-------------|
| "Add login feature" ‚Üí AI writes some login code somewhere | "Add login feature" ‚Üí AI identifies all affected NodeIDs, shows system impact, builds everything together |
| "Update the auth system" ‚Üí "What auth system? I don't see one" | "Update API_AuthCheck" ‚Üí AI knows exactly what you mean, sees all connections |
| Files and functions with no permanent identity | Every building block has a NodeID that persists forever |
| AI reads entire codebase each time (or misses connections) | AI uses visual architecture to instantly find relevant specs |
| Changes break other features ‚Üí discover during testing | AI sees ripple effects before coding ‚Üí builds complete Change Sets |
| "I'll add error handling" ‚Üí Inconsistent patterns | ARC Verification ensures every NodeID meets quality gates before completion |
| Context lost between sessions ‚Üí repetitive explanations | Perfect memory via log ‚Üí "Per the Jan 15 entry, we worked around API limitation" |
| Technical debt accumulates invisibly | Every debt logged ‚Üí REFACTOR_NodeID tasks auto-scheduled |
| Documentation drifts from reality | Specs updated to "as-built" state after every change |
| Each feature built in isolation | Visual architecture ensures system cohesion |

---

## The Noderr Loop

Every feature follows this systematic 4-step process:

**Step 1A: Impact Analysis**
‚Üí Use prompt: `ND__[LOOP_1A]__Propose_Change_Set.md`
```
You: "Add password reset"
AI: "This requires changing:
     - NEW: UI_ResetForm, API_ResetPassword
     - MODIFY: UI_LoginPage (add 'forgot password' link)
     - MODIFY: DB_Users (add reset_token field)"
```

**Step 1B: Draft Specs**
‚Üí Use prompt: `ND__[LOOP_1B]__Draft_Specs.md`
- AI marks NodeIDs as Work-In-Progress (WIP)
- Creates detailed blueprints for every affected NodeID
- You review the specifications

**Step 2: Implement Change Set**
‚Üí Use prompt: `ND__[LOOP_2]__Implement_Change_Set.md`
- AI builds ALL NodeIDs in the Change Set together
- Runs tests and verification
- Ensures quality gates are met

**Step 3: Finalize & Commit**
‚Üí Use prompt: `ND__[LOOP_3]__Finalize_And_Commit.md`
- Updates all specs to match what was built
- Logs decisions and discoveries
- Creates a clean git commit

## Installation & Setup

### The Noderr Approach

Unlike traditional tools, Noderr is installed AFTER you build your initial prototype. This ensures it documents what actually exists, not just what was planned.

### Quick Install
1. **Prepare your vision** (blueprint, project overview, architecture)
2. **Build initial prototype** with AI based on those plans
3. **Download & add Noderr** - [Get noderr-starter.zip](https://github.com/kaithoughtarchitect/noderr/releases/latest/download/noderr-starter.zip)
4. **Run Install prompt** - `ND__Install_And_Reconcile.md`
5. **Run System Audit** - `ND__Post_Installation_Audit.md`

See [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) for detailed instructions.

## Real Example

**Without Noderr:**
```javascript
// Monday: "Add user profile"
function UserProfile() { ... }

// Wednesday: "Add user settings"  
function Settings() { ... }  // New component, doesn't connect

// Friday: "Make profile show settings"
// AI: "I don't see how these relate..."
```

**With Noderr:**
```javascript
// Monday: "Add user profile"
// You: Use prompt "ND__[LOOP_1A]__Propose_Change_Set.md"
// AI: "Creating UI_UserProfile (NodeID), updating UI_Navigation to include 
//      profile link, adding API_GetProfile endpoint. All connected in architecture."

// Wednesday: "Add user settings"
// AI: "I see UI_UserProfile exists. Creating UI_UserSettings as child component,
//      adding to architecture, creating API_UpdateSettings, updating tracker."

// Friday: "Make profile show settings"  
// AI: "I see both in the architecture. They're already connected. 
//      Just need to update UI_UserProfile render method. One-line change."
```

## Critical Concepts

### The Environment Context
The AI cannot function without `environment_context.md` being configured. This file teaches the AI:
- What commands to use on YOUR system (npm vs yarn, python vs python3)
- How to run tests in YOUR setup
- Where YOUR database lives
- How to commit code in YOUR environment

### The Prompts System
You don't just chat with the AI. You use specific prompt files to trigger each phase:
```
ND__Start_Work_Session.md         ‚Üí Begin work
ND__[LOOP_1A]__Propose_Change_Set.md ‚Üí Start a feature
ND__[LOOP_1B]__Draft_Specs.md    ‚Üí Review specs
ND__[LOOP_2]__Implement_Change_Set.md ‚Üí Build it
ND__[LOOP_3]__Finalize_And_Commit.md ‚Üí Finish up
```

### ARC Verification
**A**ttentive **R**eview & **C**ompliance - Before marking any NodeID as complete, the AI verifies:
- All tests pass
- Code meets security standards
- Performance is acceptable
- Error handling is robust
- Documentation matches reality
